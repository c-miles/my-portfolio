## About

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable solutions. My journey into tech began in 2020 when I made a career pivot, teaching myself to code through online courses before attending a coding bootcamp in Columbus. Currently at Orange Barrel Media, I develop and maintain software for interactive kiosks deployed across major U.S. cities.

I specialize in creating experiences that blend intuitive design with technical excellence, using modern technologies to build features that enhance both performance and user experience. Throughout my time in the industry, I've worked on diverse projects â€” from designing scalable data systems for transit information to integrating mapping APIs for location-based services.

## Career Focus

I find the most satisfaction in solving complex problems that improve how people interact with technology in public spaces. I'm passionate about creating accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences that make a real impact on users' daily lives.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking trails with my wife, chasing achievements in video games, lifting weights, or planning our next travel adventure.
